## üíº Business Logic Implementation

### Interest Rate Calculation
```
Base Rate = Loan Type Base Rate
Risk Adjustment = Credit Score Factor + DTI Factor + Employment Factor
Final Rate = Base Rate + Risk Adjustment (minimum 50% of base rate)

Credit Score Adjustments:
- 750+: -1.5%
- 700-749: -0.5%
- 650-699: +1.0%
- 600-649: +2.5%
- <600: +4.0%

DTI Ratio Adjustments:
- >50%: +2.0%
- 40-50%: +1.0%
- 30-40%: +0.5%
- <30%: No adjustment
```

### Amortization Formula
```
Monthly Payment = P √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
Where:
P = Principal loan amount
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate √∑ 12)
n = Total number of payments
```

### Credit Scoring Algorithm
```
Base Score = (Payment History √ó 35%) + 
             (Credit Utilization √ó 30%) + 
             (Credit Length √ó 15%) + 
             (Credit Mix √ó 10%) + 
             (New Credit √ó 10%)

Adjustments:
+ Income Stability Bonus (up to 15 points)
+ Employment History Bonus (up to 10 points)
- DTI Penalty (variable based on ratio)

Final Score Range: 300-850
