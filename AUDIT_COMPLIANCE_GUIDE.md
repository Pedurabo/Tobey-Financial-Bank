    """Generate audit report"""
    # Implementation for report generation
    pass
```

### Compliance Assessment
```python
def calculate_compliance_score():
    """Calculate overall compliance score"""
    # Implementation for compliance scoring
    pass

def generate_compliance_report(report_type, department):
    """Generate compliance report"""
    # Implementation for compliance reporting
    pass
```

### Regulatory Monitoring
```python
def get_regulatory_alerts():
    """Get active regulatory alerts"""
    # Implementation for regulatory alerts
